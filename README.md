# 🎓 Student Grade Calculator in C  

This program takes input for marks in 5 subjects, calculates the percentage, and displays the grade using conditional statements in C. It helps users understand basic arithmetic operations, conditional logic, and input/output functions in C programming.  

---

## 🚀 Features:  
- Accepts user input for name and marks in 5 subjects.  
- Calculates total marks and percentage.  
- Displays grade based on percentage using conditional statements.  
- Handles name input with spaces using `fgets()`.  

---

## 🔧 What I Used:  
- **`fgets()`** for name input (handles spaces).  
- **`scanf()`** for taking marks input.  
- **Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`)** for calculating grades.  
- **Comparison Operators (`<=`, `>=`)** to determine grade boundaries.  
- **Arithmetic Operations** for total marks and percentage calculation.

## 🧮 Grade Calculation Logic:  
- `A Grade`: 90% and above  
- `B Grade`: 80% to 89%  
- `C Grade`: 70% to 79%  
- `D Grade`: 60% to 69%  
- `F Grade`: Below 60%

## 📂 How to Use:  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone [GitHub Repository Link]
   ```
2. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`):  
   ```bash
   gcc grade_calculator.c -o grade_calculator
   ```
3. Run the executable:  
   ```bash
   ./grade_calculator
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter your name and marks for 5 subjects.  
5. View your total marks, percentage, and grade.

## ⚠️ Common Errors to Avoid:  
- Using `=<` instead of `<=` in conditional statements.  
- Missing semicolons or incorrect parentheses in `printf` statements.  
- Using multiple `if` statements instead of `else if` for mutually exclusive conditions.  

---

## 💡 What's Next?  
- Adding input validation for marks.  
- Displaying subject-wise grades.  
- Enhancing the UI for a better user experience.
